# JellyBeanClub
This program is intended slightly as a joke and slightly as a serious idea. I love Jelly beans. I really love them. However, the usual flavors that you can
get year round suck. Like, really suck. I aim to make a program that would allow people to make a profile where they can choose which flavors of 
jelly beans they like. They would be able to make a list of the ones they like, the ones they don't like, the ones they are open to try, aren't open to try,
and the ones they are indecisive on. Then, the program will take the database of users and create different combinations of jelly beans to be shipped out
once a month. If a flavor shows up that someone in the database doesn't like, then it will replace it with something else that would fit in that month's 
combination of flavors. There is a lot more to it, but that's the basics of it all. I want to make a Jelly Bean Club (trademark pending) that ships out different
combinations of jelly bean flavors once a month for it's users to enjoy. They can then rate the mix, mark their favorites from the bunch, and it will update on their 
profile's preferences.
